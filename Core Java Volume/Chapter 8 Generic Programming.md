## 8.1 Why Generic Programming?
> Generic programming means writing code that can be reused for objects of many different type

Generic classes and mehods have type parameter, It is advantageous when they are instantiated with multiple type. (`ArrayList`)

### 8.1.1 The Advantage of Type Parameters

Generics offer a better solution: type parameters `<>`.It avoids casting and the compiler can check that you donâ€™t insert objects of the wrong type

### 8.1.2 Who Wants to Be a Generic Programmer?
