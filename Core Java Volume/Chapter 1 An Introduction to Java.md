* Virtual machines have the option of translating the most frequently executed bytecode sequences into machine code—a process called just-in-time compilation.
* The Java interpreter can execute Java bytecodes directly on any machine to which the interpreter has been ported
* Java programs that work on web pages are called applets. 
* Java is a programming language; XML is a way to describe data. You can process XML data with any programming language, but the Java API contains excellent support for XML processing. In addition, many important XML tools are implemented in Java. See Volume II for more information.
